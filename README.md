# onchainproofs

**The verification stack for claims, evidence, and state transitions on-chain.**

onchainproofs is a public reference project that defines how claims can be proven, verified, and audited on-chain
without relying on trust-based narratives.

This repository hosts a static specification layer.  
It does not issue assets, provide services, or operate a protocol.

---

## Purpose

On-chain systems fail where claims cannot be verified, invalidated, or audited.

onchainproofs defines a **proof-first verification model** that connects:

- claims
- evidence
- attestations
- state transitions

into an auditable on-chain lifecycle.

---

## Scope

Covered:

- Proof types (data, event, state, attestation)
- Verification flows and transitions
- Threat models and manipulation risks
- Machine-readable event logic
- Auditability and provenance

Explicitly excluded:

- Marketplaces
- Issuance platforms
- Token sales
- Legal or financial advice
